## Ice Cores:

 Antarctica's ice sheets contain a record of atmospheric conditions. Ice core drilling allows scientists to extract ice cores that provide information about past temperatures, atmospheric composition, and even evidence of past climate events such as volcanic eruptions.

## Climate Monitoring Stations:
 Antarctica hosts numerous climate monitoring stations that collect data on temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind paterns, and other meteorological parameters. These stations contribute to the understanding of the region's climate variability.
